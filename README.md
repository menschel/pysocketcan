# pysocketcan
A python 3 interface to socketcan

# Description
This module originates from Aug 2018, when the CAN_ISOTP sockettype became available in python3.7.
It was meant to test socketcan capabilities and usage on different systems.
Ever since then it is possible to set up a UDS connection to an ECU with just 2 lines of code!
